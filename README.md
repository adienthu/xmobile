mx
===================
mx is a simple tool to measure mobile experience. For any android application it generates an an experience report about  
1. Page tranistion  
2. Launch time  
3. Responsiveness  

It generates a rating (1-100) for these parameters based on profiling the application from multiple perspectives like  
1. Launch time  
2. Activity in Back Stack  
3. Overdraw Count  
4. GC overhead

### Details
Unfortunately most of the factors that define a user's mobile experience are tough to quantify, there is also a lack of comparision with peers, this tool tries to address this gap by giving a rating. For apps in the same class (complexity, functionality) app developers can compare with existing ratings and arrive at conclusions about the experience their applications offer.
